# Well Architected Framework

The purpose of this document is to be a lightweight version of the more comprehensive [AWS_Well-Architected_Framework.pdf][1]. It also pick and choose the most relevant questions provided by AWS to facilitate a Well Architected review in no more than 4 hours. Italic quotes are taken directly (or highly inspired by parts) from the AWS Well Architected Framework document.

*The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the pros and cons of decisions you make while building systems on AWS. The process for reviewing an architecture is a constructive conversation about architectural decisions, and is not an audit mechanism.*


## Introduction
*At AWS, we prefer to distribute capabilities into teams rather than having a centralized team with that capability. There are risks when you choose to distribute decision making authority, for example, ensure that teams are meeting internal standards. We mitigate these risks in two ways. First, we have **practices** that focus on enabling each team to have that capability, and we put in place experts who ensure that teams raise
the bar on the standards they need to meet. Second, we implement **mechanisms** that carry out automated checks to ensure standards are being met.*
